				<p>This is a very short introduction into what bindiffing is. After going over some of the terms related to bindiffing, and briefly looking at the structure of Windows patches, the post goes over a few tools used to diff binaries, and closed with a two minute rundown of how to run bindiff.</p>

				<p>Software Diffing - why?</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>1-days</p></li>
				<li><p>researchers, perhaps to discover whether their suggested fixes were applied</p></li>
				<li><p>compare, categorise and track the evolution of malware; this could help with attribution, however due to obfuscation it is more of a manual process</p></li>
				</ul>

				<div class="section-spacing-top"></div>
				<p>Patch Tuesday</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>Is an unofficial term used to refer to when several large companies regularly release software patches for their software products.</p></li>
				<li><p>Occurs on the second Tuesday of each month.</p></li>
				</ul>

				<div class="section-spacing-top"></div>
				<p>Microsoft on patch Tuesday usually releases security updates.</p>

				<h2># how is a Microsoft patch structured? at a glance</h2>

				<div class="section-spacing-top"></div>
				<p>Based on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/forward-reverse-differentials">ms-docs on patches</a></p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>Updates to executables are saved in Patch Storage Files (PSF) - another name for them is express download files</p></li>
				<li><p>PSF files are hosted or cached on Windows Update or other update management or distribution servers</p></li>
				<li><p>A device applying express updates uses network protocol to determine optimal differentials, then downloads only what is needed from the update distribution endpoints.</p></li>
				<li><p>Update package metadata, content manifests, and forward and reverse differentials are packaged into a cabinet file (.cab). This .cab file, and the applicability logic, will also be wrapped in Microsoft Standalone Update (.msu) format.</p></li>
				</ul>

				<p>f folder -> forward diffs</p>
				<p>r folder -> reverse diffs</p>
				<p>n folder -> null diffs (used for instance when a new file is introduced)</p>

				<h2># apply patches manually?</h2>
				<p>There is an excellent walkthrough on how to unpack an msu and apply a delta patch here: <a href="https://www.coresecurity.com/core-labs/articles/how-deal-microsoft-monthly-updates-reverse-engineering-binary-patches">fortra - coresecurity</a>.</p>

				<p>Amazing resource. Winbindex is essentially a catalogue of Windows binaries, files which appear in update packages.</p>
				<p>It allows viewing info about the files, and downloading some of them from Microsoft servers. -> exe / dll / sys files</p>
				<p>At the time of writing the servers are at <code>microsoft[.]com</code> and <code>windows[.]net</code></p>

				<h2>Running bindiff in Binary ninja</h2>

				<div class="section-spacing-top"></div>
				<p>Using bindiff / diaphora is straightforward, one needs to load the binary in a disassembler, run the initial analysis, optionally do additional analysis, export the binary ida file or bndb file, and then run bindiff across both databases.</p>

				<p>My RE tool of choice lately has been Binary Ninja. There is a pretty cool plugin called `binaryninja-bindiff-viewer` that supports the overall bindiff workflow; it is available <a href="https://github.com/PistonMiner/binaryninja-bindiff-viewer">on github here</a></p>

				<p>One needs only to compile bindiff/binexport for the specific python / Binja version.</p>

				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/binaryninja-bindiff-viewer.png" width="70%" class="displayFull" />


				<p>As an example let's compare two versions of an executable.</p>

				<p>The steps are pretty straight forward.</p>

				<p>Open two files in binja and let autoanalysis run. Once that's done, run BinExport (Plugins > BinExport) against both files / bndbs.</p>

				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/binexport-1.png" width="90%" class="displayFull" />
				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/binexport-2.png" width="90%" class="displayFull" />



				<p>This generates two `.binexport` files.</p>
				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/binexport-3.png" width="30%" class="displayFull" />



				<p>Run bindiff and pass in the `.binexport` files for comparison..</p>

				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/bindiff-3.png" width="70%" class="displayFull" />



				<p>This generates a `.bindiff` file. Open one of the files on binja, and then run BinDiff Viewer (Plugins > BinDiff Viewer) against the `.bindiff` file.</p>

				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/bindiff-1.png" width="70%" class="displayFull" />
				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/bindiff-4.png" width="70%" class="displayFull" />

				
				<p>This then displays the below table of functions mapped across the databases. These can be ordered based on similarity or bindiff confidence and so on. Double-clicking a memory location, opens it in the main Binary Ninja view. In this case the file does not appear to have been changed.</p>

				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/bindiff-5.png" width="70%" class="displayFull" />

				<p>One can use the bindiff callgraph as well on its own.</p>

				<img src="/assets/imgs/3/bindiff-7-different-example-callgraph.png" width="90%" class="displayFull" />


				<p>Having both files' graphs open side by side and using this similarity table within the disaseembler itself however, is very useful.</p>
				<p>Looking at a different example, the differences are highlighted; sections in red are more interesting.</p>
